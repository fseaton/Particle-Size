# Particle-Size

This is the analysis I've been running on the particle size data from the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme [(GMEP)](http://gmep.wales).

There's code adapted from [Salat et al (2017)](http://doi.org/10.1016/J.PHYSA.2017.01.041) for calculating multifractal parameters from the laser granulometry measurements of particle size from years 1 and 2 of GMEP.
There's also a file using the aforementioned multifractal parameters to describe soil microbial diversity measurements. And one for using Hill numbers to calculate various "D<sub>q</sub>'s" for bacterial diversity because I get distracted easily.
